# Optimization-Problems-in-Python
 A revolutionary nutritionist is devising a new diet based on only 3 basic foods. The amount of
protein, sugar, and vitamins provided by each food and the cost per serving is displayed below.
Food Cost per serving Protein (g) Sugar (g) Vitamins (g)
Chocolate bar 2 2 1 2
Cookies 1 1 3 4
Ice cream 3 1 2 6
The daily requirement for protein, sugar, and vitamins is 100g, 50g, and 25g. A balanced diet
should satisfy:
• The daily requirement for protein, sugar, and vitamins.
• The number of servings of chocolate bars should be at least twice the number of servings
of cookies and ice cream combined
• The amount of money spent on ice cream should be less than or equal to the amount of
money spent on cookies
The goal of the nutritionist is to create a minimal-cost diet.
